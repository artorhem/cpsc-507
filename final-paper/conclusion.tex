Developing and maintaining secure programs is a challenge, due to the big effort and cyber security knowledge required. Our study showed that vulnerabilities are present in popular projects on GitHub. To help developers, we designed a tool Revelio, which detects vulnerabilities in Python code, provides safe alternatives and updates outdated dependencies. Automatically generated pull-requests submitted via Revelio to various GitHub repositories fixing security issues were appreciated by developers. A user survey of the Sublime Text plugin has shown that developers find it useful and easy to use for finding vulnerable functions while writing code.

We think that answers to the research questions in this study are valuable for tools to maintain low-level software design awareness as well as for tools for detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities. Our code is published on: \url{https://github.com/scholtzan/cpsc-507}
